#  problog_tutorial

A repository of all of the examples in the problog tutorial. Directory 'originals' contains those scraped directly from the website, and 'edited' contains their equivalents edited for readability.

Tests check that every pl file in `originals/` has a counterpart in `edited`, that it is not identical, that all of the original pl scripts run successfully, and that the edited pl scripts produce the same results.
